<h3>University Event Management System</h3>

<br>

</div>

A comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline the planning, management, and participation of campus events. Zarf Token serves as a centralized hub connecting the events office, students, teaching assistants, staff, faculty, and external vendors to create a seamless event experience across the university.

## Motivation

Zarf Token solves these challenges by providing a unified platform that simplifies event management, enables seamless registration, facilitates proposals, streamlines participation, and ensures transparent workflows for all stakeholders.

- Simplifies event creation and management for the events office
- Enables seamless registration and tracking for students, TAs, and staff
- Facilitates academic event proposals from faculty members
- Streamlines vendor and external company participation in campus activities
- Implements proper approval workflows to maintain quality and compliance
- Creates transparency in event planning and participant validation
